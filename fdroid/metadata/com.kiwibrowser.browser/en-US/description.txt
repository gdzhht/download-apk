Kiwi Browser is made to browse the internet, read news, watch videos and listen to music, without annoyances.

Browse in peace.

Kiwi is based on Chromium and WebKit, the engine that powers the most popular browser in the world so you won't lose your habits.

We hope you'll love Kiwi as much as we do.

Note for power users and supporters: We have a Discord (chat) community where you can discuss development and share ideas: https://discordapp.com/invite/XyMppQq
